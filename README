OS X integration:

	- works with firefox or safari to get the current URL
	  if you don't specify one

	- uses the OSX keychain service to get/save your master
	  password

Linux integration: (gnome only, currently)

	- works with firefox to get the current URL if you don't
	  specify one (requires the "mozRepl" firefox extension
	  to be installed and running)
	
	- uses the gnomekeyring service to get/save your master
	  password
